# Energy Data Engineering-1
Linear and multilinear regression.

## Predicting the future dates
Problem statement: Analyse the data and predict the future dates for renewable energy sources.

## Features:
### Data Analysis:
- Comprehensive analysis of energy data to identify trends and patterns.

### Linear Predictions:
- Renewable Energy: Predicted the date when the share of renewables will exceed 85%.
- Gas Plants: Predicted the date when the share of gas plants will drop below 10%.
- Coal Plants: Predicted the date when all coal plants will be phased out.

### MLR Regression Model for Day-Ahead Price:
- Developed and evaluated multiple linear regression models to find the best fitting model for predicting the day-ahead energy price.

## Conclusion
We found the future dates for renewable sources.
